## What is Process Lasso?

**Process Lasso** is a sophisticated and widely recognized system utility software designed to help users manage and improve their computer's performance and responsiveness. Its core functionality revolves around intelligent automation and management of running processes, which are the programs and services operating on your PC. The software is particularly valued for its ability to automatically adjust how much CPU power each process uses, which helps in maintaining system stability and preventing a single application from overwhelming your computer's resources and causing it to become sluggish or unresponsive.

This utility is beneficial for a wide range of users, from those who simply want their computer to run more smoothly during everyday tasks to professionals who rely on their PC for resource-intensive work like video editing, 3D rendering, or software development. Process Lasso operates seamlessly in the background, requiring minimal configuration to provide its benefits. It offers a detailed view of system activity through its informative interface, which includes real-time graphs and logs, giving users valuable insights into how their computer's resources are being utilized. By optimizing process priorities and CPU affinities, Process Lasso ensures that your computing experience is as efficient and interruption-free as possible.

## üéõ Primary Features and Capabilities

The feature set of Process Lasso is comprehensive, focusing on automation and user control over system behavior.

-   **ProBalance (Process Balance):** This is the flagship technology that automatically adjusts process priorities to protect system responsiveness. It prevents background processes from negatively impacting the performance of your foreground applications.
-   **Persistent Settings:** Users can define custom rules for specific applications, such as setting a preferred CPU affinity (which cores a process runs on) or a permanent priority class. These settings are applied every time the application starts.
-   **Power Plan Automation:** The software can automatically switch your system's power plan based on which applications are running. For example, it can activate a high-performance plan when you launch a game and switch back to a balanced plan when you close it.
-   **Real-time System Monitoring:** A comprehensive interface provides real-time graphs for CPU usage, RAM usage, and I/O activity, helping users identify resource-heavy processes.
-   **User-friendly Interface:** While powerful, the software presents its options in a clear and accessible manner, making it usable for both beginners and advanced users.
